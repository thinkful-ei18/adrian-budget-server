# Windfall Backend Server
Windfall is a simplified budgeting app that lets you create and maintain a list of bills. 

The back-end server was built with Express.js and deployed with Heroku using a PostgresQL database and knex.js for query building. I also used DBeaver to create SQL scripts as an easy way to create seed data and Postman to test my endpoints. 

## Front-End Repo
The repo for the front-end can be found at: https://github.com/thinkful-ei18/adrian-budget-client. It is built with React JS, React Redux, and uses Redux forms. 

### Live App
The live app is deployed at http://adrian-budget-app.netlify.com/.
